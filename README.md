#**EA801 - Embedded Systems Repository**
This repository contains all source codes, projects, and materials developed for the EA801 - Embedded Systems discipline at [Your University/College Name, if you want to add it].

##About the Course:

The Embedded Systems (EA801) course covers the fundamentals and applications of microcontroller-based systems, low-level programming, hardware interfacing, and firmware development for embedded devices. Throughout the course, we explore topics such as microcontroller architectures, serial communication, interrupts, timers, and various peripherals.

##Repository Content:

###Here you'll find:

* Source Codes: C/C++ implementations for various exercises and practical projects.

* Projects: Complete solutions for the assigned works, which may include everything from hardware configurations to complex algorithms.

* Documentation: Reports, diagrams (if applicable), and any other relevant notes to understand the projects.

###Repository Structure:

Projects and examples are organized by topic or by lab/lecture number to facilitate navigation. Each project directory typically includes:

src/: Source files (.c, .cpp, .h).

doc/: Project-specific documentation (if any).

build/: Compiled files or executables (if generated).

###Technologies and Tools Used:

* Programming Languages: MicroPython and C++. 

* Microcontrollers: Raspberry pi pico, Raspberry pi pico w and XIAO-ESP32C3.

* Peripherals: BitDogLab, HC-05 and MPU6050

* IDEs/Tools: Arduino IDE, Thonny and VS Code.

###How to Use:

Feel free to explore the code and solutions. This repository serves as a record of my learning and development in the field of embedded systems.
